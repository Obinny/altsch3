    <!--A Research on Programming Skilled  and Languages -->

   <h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 169, 141);font-size: 650%;">Researches on programming skills and languages</h2>
   <p style="font-size: 30px;"> A programming language is a set of instructions that can be used to interact with and control a computer. These languages are used to design websites, create apps, develop operating systems, control spacecraft, and analyze data. Programming languages are necessary because computers can't understand Engish. Programming languages bridge this gap by helping programmers translate their commands into something that the computer can understand and execute.</p><hr>
   <!--Primary UsE of Programming Languages-->
   <p style="font-size: 30px;"> commands1. Some of the most popular programming languages and their uses are3:
    Python: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
    JavaScript: Rich Interactive Web Development
    Java: Enterprise Application Development
    R: Data Analysis
    C/C++: Operating Systems and System Tools
    Golang: Server-Side Programming
    C#: Application & Web Development Using .NET
    PHP:Web Development</p>
    <!--Year Of the Initial Release-->
    <p style="font-size: 30px;"> The year of initial release is 1843, by Ada Lovelace.</td></p>
    <!--Noteable Features-->
    <h2 style="font-size: 90px;background-color: rgb(188, 159, 123);"> features of programming languages</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;"> Programming languages can mainly be classified as low-level and high-level programming languages. Although simple compared to human languages, high-level languages are more complex than low-level languages. At the same time, a high-level language affords more readability in comparison to its low-level counterpart, which needs specialist knowledge in computer architecture to interpret.  </p>
    <ol type="1">
        
        <li style="font-size: 40px;">languages include assembly and machine languages.</li>
       <li style="font-size: 40px;">An assembly language contains a list of basic instructions and is much harder to read than a high-level language. It is just one level above machine code in terms of abstraction, using simple codes that are easily converted to strings of 1s and 0s (binary representation). It cannot be used to structure and manipulate complex information. </li>
       <li style="font-size: 40px;"> Machine language is directly understood by the computer’s processing unit. A programmer will first write his code in a high-level language, then compile it into a machine-readable format where instructions are represented in binary. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 40px;">languages, on the other hand, are designed to be easy to read and understood, allowing programmers to write source code using logical, meaningful words and symbols. They encapsulate everything from early algorithmic languages such as FORTRAN to more widespread, object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java.</li><br>
        </ol>

       <h2 style="background-color: rgb(182, 140, 185);font-size: 650%;"> The following activities can be performed using high-level programming languages:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;font-size: xx-large;">
        <li style="font-size: 30px;">Programs and applications development.</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence development.</li>
        <li>Database development.</li>
       <li> Video game development.</li>
        <li>Development of drivers and hardware interface.</li>
       <li> Internet and web pages development.</li>
        <li>Script development.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(107, 104, 108);font-size: 650%;font: weight 40px; ;">Main features of programming languages</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 50px;">The popularity of a programming language depends on the features and utilities it provides to programmers. But, what are the main features of programming languages? Here are the main features that a programming language must possess to stand out from all the rest:</p>
        <ol type="A" style="font-size: xx-large;">
        <li><b>Simplicity</b>: the language must offer clear and simple concepts that are easy to understand, facilitating learning and application. But simplicity can be a difficult balance to strike without compromising the overall capability of the language.</li>
       <li><b>Capability</b>: apart from being easy to use, the language must be well-equipped with a robust set of features to perform a wide range of tasks. If a programming language was designed to be used in a specific area, it must provide the necessary means (operators, structures, and syntax) to achieve ideal results. </li> 
       <li><b>Abstraction</b>: it is the language’s ability to define and use complicated structures or operations while ignoring certain low level details.</li>
       <li><b>Efficiency</b>: programming languages that can be translated and executed efficiently help avoid the excessive consumption of memory and time.</li>
        <li><b>Structuring</b>: the language allows programmers to write their code according to structured programming concepts to avoid creating errors.</li>
        <li><b>Compactness</b>: a language with this characteristic can express operations concisely without having to write too many details.</li>
        <li><b>Principal of Locality</b>: also known as the locality of reference, this phenomenon describes a computer program’s preference for continually accessing the same areas of memory over a short span of time. By enabling the usage of loops and subroutines, a programming language can exploit the principle of locality for optimising the overall performance of an application.</li>
